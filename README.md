## Quick Start

1. **Get a Claude API key** from https://console.anthropic.com/
2. **Download/Clone this repository**
3. **Download `arduino-cli.exe`** and put it in the same folder
4. **Double-click `start.bat`** 
5. **When you see "Server running"**, double-click `open-browser.bat` OR manually open browser to http://localhost:3000
6. **Enter your API key** and click "Connect" (automatically saved for future use)
7. **Start coding with Claude!**

## Prerequisites

### 1. Get a Claude API Key

**Get your API key from Anthropic:**
1. Visit https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Go to "API Keys" in your account settings
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (it starts with `sk-ant-`)

**Note:** Claude API usage is pay-per-use. Check Anthropic's pricing for current rates.

### 2. Install Node.js

**Download:** https://nodejs.org/
- Choose the LTS version (recommended for most users)
- Run the installer with default settings
- Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and type `node --version`

### 3. Install Arduino CLI

**Easy Method (Recommended):**
1. Download `arduino-cli.exe` from: https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/installation/
2. **Put `arduino-cli.exe` directly in your project folder** (same folder as `start.bat`)
3. That's it! No PATH configuration needed.

**Alternative Method:**
1. Download the Windows zip file and extract somewhere (e.g., `C:\arduino-cli\`)
2. Add the folder to your PATH (see Environment Variables in Windows)

**Verify installation:** 
- If using local method: Double-click `arduino-cli.exe` (should show help)
- If using PATH method: Open Command Prompt and type `arduino-cli version`

### 4. Configure Arduino CLI for Your Boards

**The bridge will automatically detect boards from your existing Arduino IDE installation.** If you need additional boards:

**ESP32 Setup:**
```bash
arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
```

**Teensy Setup:**
```bash
arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/package_teensy_index.json
arduino-cli core install teensy:avr
```

**Additional Arduino Boards:**
```bash
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install arduino:samd    # For MKR boards, Nano 33 IoT, etc.
arduino-cli core install arduino:mbed_nano  # For Nano 33 BLE
```

*Note: The web interface will automatically show all boards from your installed cores.*

## Installation

### Option 1: Use the Startup Script (Recommended)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Double-click `start.bat`
3. The script will:
   - Check prerequisites
   - Install Node.js dependencies
   - Start the server
   - Open your browser automatically

### Option 2: Manual Installation

9. **Monitor:** Serial output appears automatically

**API Key Management:** Once connected, use the "‚öôÔ∏è API" dropdown in the header to update or clear your API key.

**Sketch Management:** 
- üìÅ Icon = Arduino sketchbook folder
- üíæ Icon = Local project folder
- Claude automatically understands your current project context

### 3. Example Conversations

**Starting a new project:**
```
You: "Write code for ESP32 that blinks an LED on pin 2 with a 1-second interval"

Claude: "Here's code for blinking an LED..."
[Code appears in chat and is ready for compilation]

[Click Save] ‚Üí [Click Compile] ‚Üí [Click Upload] ‚Üí [LED starts blinking]
```

**Working with existing sketches:**
```
[Load existing sketch from dropdown]

You: "Add a button on pin 4 that changes the blink speed when pressed"

Claude: "I can see your current LED blink code. Here's how to add button control..."
[Modified code appears, understanding your existing project]

[Click Save] ‚Üí [Click Compile] ‚Üí [Click Upload] ‚Üí [Enhanced functionality]
```

### 4. Advanced Features

- Try double-clicking `arduino-cli.exe` directly to test it
- Restart Command Prompt after PATH changes
- For local method: Right-click `arduino-cli.exe` ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Unblock if downloaded from internet

### "Claude API key issues"
- Make sure your API key starts with `sk-ant-`
- Check that your API key is valid at https://console.anthropic.com/
- Ensure you have sufficient credits in your Anthropic account
- API keys are automatically saved - you only need to enter once
- Use the "Clear" button if you need to enter a new key
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- If localStorage is disabled, the key won't save between sessions

### "API request failed" errors
- 401 error: Invalid API key
- 429 error: Rate limit exceeded, wait and try again
- 403 error: Check your account status and billing
- Network errors: Check your internet connection
- **If using local method:** Make sure `arduino-cli.exe` is in the same folder as `start.bat`
- **If using PATH method:** Make sure Arduino CLI is installed and in your PATH
- Try double-clicking `arduino-cli.exe` directly to test it
- Restart Command Prompt after PATH changes
- For local method: Right-click `arduino-cli.exe` ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Unblock if downloaded from internet

### "No boards detected"
- Check USB cable connection
- Install proper drivers for your board
- Click "Refresh Ports" button
- For ESP32: Install CP210x or CH340 drivers

### "No boards in dropdown" or "Loading boards..."
- Make sure you have Arduino cores installed: `arduino-cli core list`
- Install cores for your boards (see configuration section above)
- Check the browser console for error messages
- The dropdown will show "Loading boards..." until it gets a response from Arduino CLI

### "Compilation failed"
- Check that the correct core is installed
- Ask Claude to fix the code based on error messages
- Verify board selection matches your hardware

### "Upload failed"
- Ensure correct port is selected
- Check that board is not running other serial programs
- Try pressing reset button during upload
- For ESP32: Hold BOOT button during upload if needed

### "Can't connect to localhost:3000"
- Make sure the server is actually running (you should see "Server running on http://localhost:3000")
- Check for error messages when running `start.bat`
- Try running `node server.js` directly to see detailed error messages
- Make sure port 3000 isn't being used by another program
- Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking the connection

## Development

### Adding New Boards

Edit `public/index.html` and add options to the board-select dropdown:

```html
<option value="your:board:fqbn">Your Board Name</option>
```

### Customizing the Interface

- **Colors/Styling:** Edit the CSS in `public/index.html`
- **Board Presets:** Modify the board dropdown options
- **Serial Settings:** Adjust baud rates and timeouts in the JavaScript

### Claude API Integration

*Note: This prototype doesn't include Claude API integration. For full functionality, you would need to:*

1. Get an Anthropic API key
2. Add API calling code to the `sendMessage()` function
3. Handle streaming responses from Claude

## Security Notes

**API Key Handling:**
- API keys are saved to your browser's localStorage for convenience
- Keys persist between sessions (no need to re-enter each time)
- Use the "Clear" button to remove your saved key when needed
- The input field is password-masked for security
- Keys are stored locally on your machine only
- Never share your API key with others

**Network Security:**
- All API calls use HTTPS encryption
- The bridge server runs locally on your machine
- No data is sent to third-party servers except Anthropic's API
- Your API key never leaves your local machine except for direct API calls to Claude

## Safety Notes

**For Embedded Development:**
- Always test code in safe environments before deploying to production
- Use proper isolation and protection for high-voltage or high-current applications
- Follow standard electrical safety practices and component ratings
- This tool is for development and prototyping - production systems should have additional safety layers and testing
- Be mindful of proper power supply design and thermal considerations
